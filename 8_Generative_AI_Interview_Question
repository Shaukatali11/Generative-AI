Q1. What is Generative AI?
    Generative AI refers to a branch of artificial intelligence that generates new, original, and creative content such as text,
  images, music, or videos. Unlike traditional AI tasks like prediction or classification, which work on recognizing patterns
  and making decisions based on existing data, generative AI creates something entirely new. It relies on complex models to 
  understand underlying data structures and produce outputs that mimic human-like creativity.
  Example: GPT-4 generates human-like text, and DALL-E creates images from textual descriptions.


Q2. Applications of Generative AI
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks:
    Writing essays, summarizing articles, and chatbot responses.
    Example: ChatGPT for conversational AI.

    Healthcare:
    Generating synthetic medical images to train models or assist in drug discovery.
    Example: Creating virtual drug molecules for research.

    Content Generation:
    Creating blogs, news articles, scripts, or product descriptions.
    Example: AI tools like Jasper for content writing.

    Image/Video Generation:
    Designing graphics, animations, or enhancing video quality.
    Example: Generating lifelike portraits using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).

    Finance:
    Simulating market scenarios, generating reports, or fraud detection through synthetic data.


Q3. How Does Generative AI Work?
Generative AI operates using deep learning techniques, especially neural networks, to learn patterns and relationships 
within vast datasets. Key steps include:

Training:
The model learns patterns, features, and structures from a large dataset, such as text or images.

Model Types:
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two networks (generator and discriminator) work together to improve output quality.
Transformer Models: Large language models like GPT use transformers for contextual understanding.

Creation:
Once trained, the model generates new content by applying the learned patterns to create coherent outputs.
Example: For text generation, the model predicts the next word based on the previous sequence, creating sentences that mimic
human writing. For image generation, GANs create realistic images by refining outputs through feedback.
